# Assemblies

#### Where Developers Connect

---

- Assemblies is an open-source mobile app built with `React Native` which developers can use to connect through 'assemblies' in their area.
- The app is the basis for a tutorial on `React Native` at [www.buildreactnative.com](http://www.buildreactnative.com) though the actual app will contain features not covered in the tutorial.

## Contributing

- Currently, the app has room for a lot of improvements. We would like to add comprehensive testing, a Flux architecture (preferably `Redux`), and some more nuanced database querying. Feel free to post feature requests and bugs in the `issues` section. Pull requests are welcome but should be clear and easy-to-follow.

## Running locally

- Here are the steps to running the app locally on your machine.
  - Make sure you're running, at least, node version 4.0.0 - you can check your node version by running ```node -v``` in your terminal
  - `git clone https://github.com/buildreactnative/assemblies`
  - `cd assemblies`
  - `npm install`
  - `open ios/assembly.xcworkspace`
  - before you run the app, you have to create a file `Keys.plist` - this is what the main file `AppDelegate.m` uses to load analytics. Without the file, Xcode will throw an error if you try to run. So in the main `assembly` folder, click `file` > `new` > `File...` > then select `Resource` => `Property List`, and title it `Keys.plist`. In the file, add a key `SEGMENT_API_KEY` and give it the value of any string. Make sure that `Keys.plist` doesn't get committed to git (you can place this file in a `.gitignore` file).
  - Install react-native-cli `npm install -g react-native-cli`. Its recommended to be installed globally.
  - `cd iod` and `pod install`
  - choose which simulator you would like to use and hit the `run` button in Xcode

## Things to test and improve
  - user account creation
  - user login / logout
  - navigation between different tabs
  - creating a group
  - creating an event
  - finding available events
  - messaging other users
